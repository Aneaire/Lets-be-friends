## üõ† Deployment Notes

To ensure that emails are sent successfully from your application, you need to configure an **SMTP provider** in **Appwrite**.

We recommend using **Postmark** as the SMTP provider for reliable transactional email service.

### Recommended SMTP Provider:

- **Postmark**: [Get started here](https://postmarkapp.com/)

### üìß SMTP Configuration in Appwrite

1. **Sign up for a Postmark account**.
2. **Configure Postmark**:
   - Use the SMTP credentials from Postmark.
   - Set up the following in the Appwrite Console under **Settings** > **SMTP**:
     - **SMTP Server Host**: `smtp.postmarkapp.com`
     - **SMTP Port**: `587` (for TLS)
     - **Username**: Your Postmark API token
     - **Password**: Leave this blank (Postmark only requires the API token as the username)
3. **Save** the configuration.

For more details on Postmark's SMTP settings, check out the [Postmark SMTP documentation](https://postmarkapp.com/developer/user-guide/smtp).

### Setting up Realtime

Fix the port in compose.yml might not work when

```docker-compose.yml
ports:
      - 9505:80
```

Refer to

[Link to docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite/blob/ae87033974a700b4c2cd6e8935a436bae0d61670/docker-compose.yml#L201)

---

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: If you do not configure an SMTP provider, your app might fail to send important transactional emails.

---

That's it! Now you're ready to deploy your app.
